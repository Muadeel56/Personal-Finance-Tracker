## Instructions for ChatGPT

Write a LinkedIn post that:
1. Sounds natural and human (not AI-generated)
2. Shows genuine excitement about completing the project
3. Mentions the learning experience and challenges overcome
4. Lists the key features built
5. Uses conversational tone with some personality
6. Includes relevant hashtags
7. Keeps it concise but informative
8. Avoids overly formal or corporate language
9. Shows passion for coding and building things
10. Mentions that it's actually useful for personal use

The post should sound like it was written by a real developer who's excited to share their work, not like a resume or job application. Make it conversational and authentic.
