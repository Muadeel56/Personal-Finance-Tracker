# 🐛 Critical UI/UX Issues Fixed - Finance Tracker Application

## 📋 Issue Summary
Fixed multiple critical UI/UX issues in the Finance Tracker application that were affecting user experience and functionality across various components.

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. **Theme Compatibility Issues**
**Problem**: Multiple components were not properly adapting to theme changes
- Transaction page background not changing with theme
- Category badges in tables not displaying properly in light mode
- Hardcoded colors instead of CSS variables

**Solution**: 
- Updated all components to use CSS variables (`var(--color-*)`) instead of hardcoded colors
- Fixed background colors, text colors, and border colors across all pages
- Ensured consistent theme switching behavior

### 2. **Category Modal Blank Screen Issue**
**Problem**: Category creation/editing modal was showing blank screen or closing unexpectedly
- Modal was closing when clicking inside the form
- Poor backdrop handling causing accidental closures
- Inconsistent modal behavior

**Solution**:
- Fixed modal backdrop click handling with proper event propagation
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent modal content clicks from closing the modal
- Improved modal structure and event handling
- Enhanced user experience with better modal interactions

### 3. **Budget Creation Functionality**
**Problem**: Budget creation was failing with "createBudget is not a function" error
- Missing or broken context implementation
- No proper error handling for budget operations

**Solution**:
- Implemented local state management for budgets
- Added proper CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Added toast notifications for user feedback
- Implemented loading states and error handling
- Added form validation and data persistence

### 4. **Currency Formatting Issues**
**Problem**: 
- `formatCurrency` function was not defined causing runtime errors
- Currency displayed in USD ($) instead of PKR
- Inconsistent currency formatting across components

**Solution**:
- Fixed `formatCurrency` import errors by implementing local currency formatting
- Changed all currency displays from USD ($) to PKR
- Updated currency formatting across:
  - Dashboard statistics
  - Transaction list
  - Budget pages
  - Reports pages
  - All components using currency

### 5. **Modal UX Improvements**
**Problem**: Poor modal user experience across the application
- Cancel buttons not clearly visible
- Inconsistent modal behavior
- Poor visual feedback

**Solution**:
- Enhanced cancel button styling with better hover effects
- Improved modal backdrop handling
- Added consistent modal behavior across all components
- Enhanced visual feedback and transitions

### 6. **Reports Page Errors**
**Problem**: Reports page was showing blank screen due to `formatCurrency` errors
- JavaScript runtime errors preventing page rendering
- Missing currency formatting function

**Solution**:
- Fixed `formatCurrency` function implementation in Reports component
- Updated all currency displays to use PKR format
- Ensured proper error handling and fallbacks
