# LinkedIn Post - Personal Finance Tracker

Just wrapped up building a full-stack personal finance tracker! ðŸš€

Been working on this React + Django project for the past few days and honestly, it's been quite the learning experience. Built everything from scratch - user authentication, transaction management, budget tracking, and even a category system.

What I built:
â€¢ React frontend with modern UI (Tailwind CSS)
â€¢ Django REST API backend
â€¢ PostgreSQL database
â€¢ Real-time transaction tracking
â€¢ Budget management with visual reports
â€¢ User profiles and settings

The tech stack was fun to work with - React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL for data storage. Had to tackle some interesting challenges along the way like CORS issues, authentication flows, and making sure everything played nicely together.

Really happy with how the UI turned out - clean, responsive, and actually usable. The dark/light theme toggle was a nice touch too.

This project really helped me get comfortable with full-stack development and API integration. Plus, it's actually something I'd use myself to track my own finances!
